# - Accept only JPEG/PNG via content type AND file content validation
# - Enforce MAX_FILE_SIZE
# - Save valid files to UPLOAD_DIR asynchronously
# - Extract image metadata (width, height, format) using Pillow
# - Add DB record for file and metadata via injected session
# - Log every upload event/exception with structured data
# - Return Pydantic error/response schema

    # --- YOUR IMPLEMENTATION GOES HERE ---
    # Implement all functional and validation logic as described above.
    # (Pseudocode below; fill in/refactor for working solution.)
    #
    # - Read the uploaded file in chunks to check size and type.
    # - If invalid type/size, raise HTTPException and log event.
    # - Save valid files to UPLOAD_DIR asynchronously (unique filenames).
    # - Open with Pillow to extract image metadata (try/except for errors).
    # - If image valid, create and commit DB record.
    # - Log event (success or specific error) with structured details.
    # - Return ImageUploadResponse or image-specific error response.
